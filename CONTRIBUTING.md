# Contributing

Obrigado por contribuir com **Skill Audit**. Este repositório contém uma Agent Skill; mudanças aqui alteram como agentes se comportam, tomam decisões, consultam contexto e pedem consentimento ao usuário.

## Principles

Contributions should preserve three properties: **clareza operacional**, **segurança por consentimento** and **mínima complexidade suficiente**. Do not add process for its own sake. Add rules only when they reduce ambiguity, prevent unsafe behavior or improve repeatability.

## What to change where

| Need | Preferred file |
|---|---|
| Agent behavior, activation rules or output format | `SKILL.md` |
| Human-facing explanation, installation or examples | `README.md` |
| Reusable protocols or deeper guidance | `references/` |
| Reusable deliverable formats | `templates/` or `examples/` |
| Validation or automation | `scripts/` |
| Release notes | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| Maintenance rules | `GOVERNANCE.md` |

## Version-check requirement

Any behavioral change must preserve the origin version check rule: the skill may consult its upstream repository, read README/CHANGELOG, summarize changes and ask whether the user wants to update, but it must never update itself silently or overwrite local edits without explicit approval.

## Before opening a pull request

Run the local validation command when present:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_skill.py
```

Then review the diff manually and answer these questions in the PR description:

| Question | Expected answer |
|---|---|
| Did this change alter agent behavior? | Explain the behavior. |
| Is this a breaking change for existing users? | Yes/No, with reason. |
| Does the update preserve explicit user consent before self-update? | Yes. |
| Were local validation checks run? | Include command and result. |

## Change history

| Date | Time | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-02 | 09:02 GMT-3 | Added contribution guidelines for maintaining the skill as an update-aware public repository. |
